> The design of CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNAs is not trivial, and is a computationally demanding task. Design tools need to identify target  sequences that will maximise the likelihood of obtaining the desired  cut, whilst minimising off-target risk. There is a need for a tool that  can meet both objectives while remaining practical to use on large  genomes.
>
> Here, we present Crackling, a new method that is more suitable for meeting these objectives. We test its performance on  12 genomes and on data from validation studies. Crackling maximises  guide efficiency by combining multiple scoring approaches. On  experimental data, the guides it selects are better than those selected  by others. It also incorporates Inverted Signature Slice Lists (ISSL)  for faster off-target scoring. ISSL provides a gain of an order of  magnitude in speed, while preserving the same level of accuracy.  Overall, this makes Crackling a faster and better method to design guide RNAs at scale.
