## Nick Meurant

I mostly worked on the EC2 aspect of this project, I implemented the EC2Stack and was responsible for creating the schedulder lambda function.  I spent quite alot of time benchmarking and running statistical analysis to create an accurate estimation for the needed RAM from initial file size.  I also spent alot of time working with Mackenzie porting his lambda function code so that it could correctly work within an EC2 environment.
